 * All algorithms implemented in PaGMO must derive from this base class. This base class provides each algorithm with one pagmo::rng_double
 * and one pagmo::rng_uint32 random number generators. Each algorithm must implement the base::evolve() method.
 *
 * \section Serialization
 * The algorithm classes are serialized for the purpose of being transmitted over a distributed environment.
 * Serializing a derived algorithm requires that the needed serialization libraries be declared in their header of the derived class. 
 * Virtually all the derived algorithm classes need to have the following declared in the header files:
@verbatim
	friend class boost::serialization::access;
	template<class Archive>
@endverbatim
 * Each derived class must implement implicitly, in its header file, the serialize method, which must contain the pointer to the base class like:
@verbatim
	ar & boost::serialization::base_object<base>(*this);
@endverbatim
 * and the rest of the attributes simply as archive members: 
@verbatim
	ar & attribute_name;
@endverbatim
 * In order to be able to identify the dervied class from a base_pointer the derived class needs to be registered. This is done by registering the class in the "pagmo/src/algorithms.h", in the REGISTER_ALGORITHM_SERIALIZATIONS() routine.
 * Notes: 
 * - "const" attributes need to be cast as constants in the serialize method using const_cast
 * - attributes that that are not primitives, need be a serialized type as well
 * - pointers to primitives cannot be serialized (in this case one can split the serialize method into save/load methods and store the values, that the pointers refer to, into temporary variables which are serialized insted - see boost serialize documentation on the topic if needed)
